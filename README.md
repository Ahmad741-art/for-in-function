Key Points:

Iterable Objects: for loops can iterate over any iterable object, like lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, and ranges.

No Indexing Needed: Unlike some other languages, you don't need to manually manage loop counters or indexes.

Flexible and Powerful: You can use for loops with functions, comprehensions, and various control flow mechanisms to handle complex iteration scenarios.
